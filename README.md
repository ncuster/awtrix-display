# awtrix-display
## My simple awtrix display project

This is a simple shell script that will display some simple things that I like to see:
- The lake level for a lake I like to go to
- The discharge level, from the dam, for the same lake
- The current outside temp

Eventually I'll convert this to go, for now it is a simple shell script that writes to mqtt, and I have an awtrix setup to read from mqtt.
